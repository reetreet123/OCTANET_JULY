# To Do List

I have made this project using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

By leveraging these powerful technologies, I was able to design and develop an intuitive and visually appealing interface for our to-do list. Here's how each technology played a vital role in this accomplishment:

1️⃣ HTML: I utilized HTML to structure the content of the to-do list, ensuring proper organization and semantic markup. This allowed for clear and logical hierarchy, making the list easy to navigate and comprehend.

2️⃣ CSS: With CSS, I added style and visual enhancements to the to-do list, creating a polished and professional look. I leveraged CSS to customize colors, typography, and layout, ensuring a visually engaging user experience.

3️⃣ JavaScript: JavaScript brought interactivity and dynamic functionality to the to-do list. By using JavaScript, I implemented features such as task creation, deletion, and updating in real-time. This enhanced usability and provided a seamless user experience.
